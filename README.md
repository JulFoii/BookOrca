# BookOrca

BookOrca is a e-book organization program designed to simplify the management of digital books.

## How it Works

- **Metadata Retrieval:** Utilizes the OpenLibrary API to automatically fetch metadata such as author, title, ISBN, and cover images based on the name of the file.

- **File Type Compatibility:** Supports all file types, as we open the default program associated with that specific file extension (e.g., a PDF viewer for PDF files).

## Installation

## Acknowledgments

The WPF-Libary [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) helped us greatly with the customization of our User Interfaces and being able to implement theming easily.

## Project Background

This project was made as an Intermediate Level Project by four software development apprentices at the school "Berufskolleg Ostvest" in Datteln, Germany.
